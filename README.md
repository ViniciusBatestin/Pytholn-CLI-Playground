# Pytholn-CLI-Playground

### Scenario
Little Lemon is a charming neighborhood bistro that serves simple food and classic cocktails in a lively but casual environment. The restaurant features a locally sourced menu with daily specials.
The restaurant is in the process of transition from a one-page website to a database driven web application using the Django framework.
For the menu page, the owners would like to store the menu information in a database that can be updated as the menu changes seasonally.
Managers need to be able to add or update menu by changing details for the name, description, price, or photo.
This information will be displayed on a dedicated menu item page that will load when the users click on a menu item from the Menu page.
